## Features

- Autocomplete search bar
- Drag a map pin to reveal selected location
- Toast when an invalid location is selected


## Tech

This simple web App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [NEXT.JS] - Great for its easy to use structure and large template selection!
- [react-google-maps/api] - Awesome library to handle almost any functionality of Google Maps API!
- [react-hot-toast] - My favourite way of handling notifications on a webpage!


## Installation

This project was designed for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.13.0+ to run.

> Note: Before running the code, create a file `.env.local`. Copy and paste the contents of the `.env.template` file(you may then delete the template file). Replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` value with your own API key. For more info on how to do that, visit the help page for [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key).

To install the dependencies and start the server, navigate to the root directory of the source code and use the following commands

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```
